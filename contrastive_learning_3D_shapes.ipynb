    "One of the main problems of the project is how to manage the 3D point cloud. To do this, it is possible to take different approaches such as `Voxelization` (which is not very efficient) or `Multi-View`, i.e. look at the object from different angles and take 2D photos to use as input for a CNN. The latter approach is more efficient than the former, but we don't really use 3D information. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are Deep Learning models that can operate directly on the point cloud itself, thanks to the fact that they are invariant with respect to permutations and therefore to the ordering of points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of these models are: `PPFNet`, `PointNet`/`Pointnet++`, `EdgeConv`/`DynamicEdgeConv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Medium](https://medium.com/@sanketgujar95/dynamic-graph-cnn-edge-conv-2582c3eb18d8): *EdgeConv is inspired from PointNet and convolutional operations, but instead of working on individual points it exploits the geometric structure by constructing a local neighborhood graph and applying convolution-like operation on the edge connecting the neighborhood pair of points. It thus has the property of translation-invariant and non-locality.*\n",
    "\n",
    "To use these Convolutional Layers correctly I used the code of the examples [1](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/a6e349621d4caf8b381fe58f8e57109b2d0947ed/examples/dgcnn_segmentation.py), [2](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/a6e349621d4caf8b381fe58f8e57109b2d0947ed/examples/dgcnn_classification.py),  mentioned in the previous section, provided by the Pytorch Geometric library.\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop the architecture of my model, I took ispiration from [SimCLR](https://colab.research.google.com/github/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks/blob/master/docs/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial17/SimCLR.ipynb#scrollTo=nRRiSml1GhVQ) and [Tutorial 3: Train SimCLR on Clothing](https://docs.lightly.ai/self-supervised-learning/tutorials/package/tutorial_simclr_clothing.html) where an **End-to-End** architecture is used, in which the authors generate two views of an image, so they do not use the original data point but attract and reject the representations of all the augmented images. This prevents the model from learning how an image was augmented.\n",

    "For each sample $x$, we generate two augmented versions ($\\tilde{x} _i $ and $ \\tilde{x}_j $), which we will pass to the encoder $f(\\cdot)$, consisting of two `DynamicEdgeConv` layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we pass this to the `Projection Head` $g(\\cdot)$, a fully connected network, that maps the representation $h$ into a smaller space where we apply the loss function. The reason why it is necessary to apply the Projection Head is that most similarity measures that are used in contrastive losses suffer from the curse of dimensionality. \n",

    "As Loss function I used the `NTXent Loss`, sometimes also called `InfoNCE`, which is implemented in the [PyTorch Metric Learning](https://kevinmusgrave.github.io/pytorch-metric-learning/losses/#ntxentloss) library, which has the `Temperature` as hyperparameter which helps to balance the similarity measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the NTXent Loss compares the similarity of $z_i = g(h_i)$ and  $z_j = g(h_j)$,  to the similarity of $z_i$ to any other representation in the batch $z_k$, by performing a *softmax* over the similarity values. The loss can be formally written as:\n",

    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{i,j}=-\\log \\frac{\\exp(\\text{sim}(z_i,z_j)/\\tau)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{2N}\\mathbb{1}_{[k\\neq i]}\\exp(\\text{sim}(z_i,z_k)/\\tau)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is the *temperature*, $\\mathbb{1}_{[k \\neq i]}$ is an indicator function (1 if $k\\neq i$ 0 otherwise), and $sim()$ is the application of Cosine Similarity."
